# ATM (React.js)

## Requirements

The task is to create an ATM machine. The ATM should allow depositing and withdrawing money. The ATM should not allow withdrawing more money than the account balance.

Required elements:

1. Buttons for withdrawing and depositing
2. ATM-like keyboard (in the app) to enter the amount of money to deposit or withdraw with an option to clear the input
3. Display to show the amount of money to deposit or withdraw
4. Display to show account balance

What is not required:

1. Login (user is already logged)
2. Choosing a card (there is only one card/account)

## Setup

I bootstrapped the project with the latest version of Vite template.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Vite dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the app with `npm run dev`.
